      <h1>Fictional Characters</h1>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="./pictures/luffy.png" width="200" />
        <p>
          <strong> #1: Monkey D. Luffy </strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Media: One Piece</strong>
          <br /><br />

          The reason Luffy is one my top 5 favorite characters is because he's
          funny, goofy, and caring. throughout the show he's making new friends
          by just being himself. If his friends are in trouble he makes sure to
          help them. <br />Most times even when he meets someone new that he
          barely just met, he will do anything to help them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="./pictures/rwby_ruby_rose.png" width="200" />

        <p>
          <strong> #2: Ruby Rose </strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Media: RWBY</strong>
          <br /><br />

          The reason Ruby is one of my top 5 favorite characters is because she
          represents the idea that you don't need to be perfect. Throughout the
          show she makes a lot of mistakes, and those mistakes feel even more
          heavy because she's a team leader. She shows it's okay to fail, and
          you don't have to keep a brave face all the time. And just like Luffy,
          she can be really goofy at times, clumsy or just silly.

      <div class="container">
        <img src="./pictures/eikichi-onizuka.png" width="200" />

        <p>
          <strong> #3: Eikichi Onizuka </strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Media: Great Teacher Onizuka</strong>
          <br /><br />

          The reason Onizuka is one of my top 5 favorite characters is because
          in the show he goes through life without worrying too much about
          anything. He's not really a serious character, and acts really
          immature for his age. But he shows that sometimes in life you just
          have to relax a bit, make little things count. He teaches you how to
          live your life. One of my favorite quotes from him is<strong
            >"It doesn't matter what some people say. Right? As long as you're
            sure about how you really feel. You focus on that and everything
            else just disappears."</strong
          >

      <div class="container">
        <img src="./pictures/goku.png" width="200" />

        <p>
          <strong> #4: Son Goku </strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Media: Dragon Ball</strong>
          <br /><br />

          The Reason Goku is one of my top 5 favorite characters is because of
          his determination to get stronger. According to the story he was
          actually considered a weak Saiyan, but ever since he was a kid, he's
          constanstly getting stronger than people who were once stronger than
          him. Goku proves that if you work hard enough and have a strong focus
          you can achieve your goals.

      <div class="container">
        <img src="./pictures/kamina.png" width="200" />

        <p>
          <strong> #5: Kamina </strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Media: Gurren Lagann</strong>
          <br /><br />

          The Reason Kamina is one of my top 5 favorite characters he shows how
          sometimes to be the best you, you just need a little push, or a BIG
          push from someone. He kept pushing his brother to break out of his
          shell and become stronger. One of his quotes is literally
          <strong>"Kick logic to the curb and do the impossible!"</strong>
          Basically saying stop caring if the goal seems impossbile, go for it.
